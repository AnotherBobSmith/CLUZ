# CLUZ

CLUZ (Conservation Land-Use Zoning software) is a QGIS plug-in that lets users design conservation area and nature recovery networks. It can be used for terrestrial and marine on-screen planning and also acts as a link for the Marxan and Marxan with Zones conservation planning software packages.

It was developed by Bob Smith, from the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology (DICE), and funded by the UK Government's Darwin Initiative.
